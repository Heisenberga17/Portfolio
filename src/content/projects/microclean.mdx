## Overview

MicroClean is a professional cleaning service operating in Panama City. The platform streamlines the customer experience from initial quote to booking confirmation.

## My Role

As developer and co-owner, I built the web platform and the backend systems that power the quotation engine and booking flow.

## Key Features

- **Instant Quotes** - Intelligent quotation system based on property size, type, and services needed
- **Online Booking** - Simple booking flow that connects customers with available cleaning teams
- **Service Catalog** - Detailed breakdown of residential and commercial cleaning services
- **Contact Integration** - Direct WhatsApp integration for customer support

## Challenges & Solutions

Building a quotation system that accurately reflects real-world pricing required close collaboration with the operations team. I created a flexible pricing engine that accounts for square footage, number of rooms, and service add-ons while remaining easy to update as prices change.

## Results

The platform has streamlined the booking process, reducing the time from inquiry to confirmed booking and providing customers with transparent, instant pricing.
