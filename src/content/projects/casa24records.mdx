## Overview

Casa 24 Records is an independent hip-hop collective from Panama City. The website serves as the digital hub for seven artists who create genre-fluid music spanning rap, R&B, indie, and Latin styles.

## My Role

As founder and developer, I conceptualized and built the entire digital presence for the collective, integrating multiple music platform APIs to create a unified experience.

## Key Features

- **Artist Profiles** - Individual pages for each of the seven artists with bios and discographies
- **Spotify Integration** - Live streaming data, latest releases, and embedded players
- **YouTube Feed** - Music videos and visual content pulled directly from the YouTube API
- **Release Calendar** - Upcoming releases and events for fans to follow
- **Brand Identity** - Cohesive visual identity across the platform

## Challenges & Solutions

Integrating multiple third-party APIs (Spotify, YouTube) while maintaining fast load times was the primary challenge. I implemented a caching layer using Cloudflare Workers KV that refreshes data periodically, ensuring fresh content without hitting API rate limits on every page load.

## Results

The platform has become the central hub for the collective's digital presence, providing fans with a single destination to discover music, watch videos, and stay updated on new releases.
