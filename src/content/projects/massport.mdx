## Overview

Massport is a comprehensive football tournament management platform built specifically for the Panamanian sports community. It provides a complete solution for organizing and following local football tournaments.

## My Role

As the full-stack developer, I designed and built the entire platform from the ground up, handling everything from the database architecture to the real-time scoring interface.

## Key Features

- **Tournament Management** - Create and manage multiple tournaments with custom rules and formats
- **Team Registration** - Streamlined registration flow for teams and players
- **Live Scores** - Real-time score updates during matches
- **Standings & Stats** - Automatic calculation of standings, goal differentials, and player statistics
- **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for on-the-go access from the field

## Challenges & Solutions

The biggest challenge was implementing real-time score updates without a traditional WebSocket server. I leveraged Cloudflare Workers with KV storage to create a polling-based system that delivers near-instant updates while keeping costs minimal.

## Results

The platform has successfully managed multiple tournaments in Panama City, providing organizers with a professional digital tool that replaces manual spreadsheets and WhatsApp groups.
